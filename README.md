Authors:  Kuan Wei Heng (@xsot), Dominic Chong (@bannified)

### Instructions

1. Ensure that the main.cpp file remains in the same directory as all the other header files (Particle.h, vector2.h, collision.h)
2. Run the following command to compile: `g++ -O3 fopenmp -std=c++14 main.cpp`
3. Place the output ./a.out binary into the same directory as the sample input (\*.in) and `bench.py`.
4. Run `bench.py` to run the benchmarking tests. Use `diff` to check for differences between your output and the sample output (\*.out)
5. Alternatively, you can also generate your own sample inputs with the `gen.py` script.
